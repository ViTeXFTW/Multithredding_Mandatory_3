Mandatory Assignment 3 - Group 13.
Sudoku solver
-----------------------------------

For this assignment we have decided to create a sudoku solver.
In sudokus you normally need to look for one number at a time. And then
go through every number from 1-9. For this assignment we thougth about how much
faster it would be if you were able to look for every number at the same time. 

For this we created a solver which creates a thread for each number, and all these threads
share the same board and work on it at the same time. Every individual thread is just running a
brute force method where we check every available positions if that threads number can be
placed in the box. When a number is placed the whole board is updated and all threads gets an updated
version of the board.
